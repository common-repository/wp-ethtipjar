== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does it really write to the Ethereum Blockchain?  =

Yes! The **Main Ethereum Network** is used. Use a site like [etherchain.org](https://etherchain.org) to search for your public key after you put your commitment on the blockchain. 

= Nothing happens when I click the “Put it on the blockchain” button =

Be sure MetaMask is running in your browser. You must be logged into MetaMask and have the necessary amount of ETH. Note: You will have to confirm the transaction in MetaMask.
